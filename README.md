# Dark Modern Modified

A theme extension that is mostly based on the oh so joyous blues, purples and whites for a majority of code displayed, with the accent colors of yellow and mint.

Comments are displayed as a neutral italicized gray that is easy to read, but not such a background color it's easy to miss.

I've found myself perfectly addicted to this color schema as it forces me to read a lot more of what's going on without being too flat of a color scheme. The goal was to make reading code still fun to not be overly easy or overly difficult with too much or too little color.
